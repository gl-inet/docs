You can compile a firmware with tons of features and writing data is almost instant.\n\n\nBy adding PCIe interface, a 5G 802.11a/ac addon module can be connected and you can enjoy the wifi speed on a mini router.\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nBy adding a fast Nand flash, you can feel how the performance is improved compared to a Nor flash router.\n\n\nThe performance comparision between AR300M (nand) with AR150 is below:\n\n\n\n\nIt only takes 6 seconds to upload and process 250 ovpn files. When installing packages to the router, it takes no more than 20% for the time spent than using nor flash, including the time to download resource from the Internet. So everything just happends in seconds.\n\n\nBuilding Firmware\n\n\nThe router has two flash so we have two firmwares. One firmware is installed on the Nor flash and one is installed on the nand flash. The two firmware is independent from each other. The router will always try to boot from the nand flash. If it fails for 3 times it will boot from the Nor flash.\n\n\nBy using two firmwares, businesses can have dual boot options to ensure the system can backup, upgrade and boot without problems.\n\n\nBuilding the generic firmware for nor flash\n\n\nThe simple instructions of building the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01\nYou need to have a Linux machine. In this example we use Ubuntu.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip git wget\n$ git clone https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc.git\n$ cd openwrt-cc\n$ ./scripts/feeds update -a\n$ ./scripts/feeds install -a\n$ make menuconfig\n  ..choose your compile target and packages\n$ make\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nor flash, choose \nGL-AR300M\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nBuild the nand firmware for nand flash\n\n\nIf you want to build the firmware for nand flash, first choose subtarget \nGeneric devices with NAND flash\n then choose \nGL-AR300M Nand\n as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe make process will takes around 1 hour for the first time because it needs to download a lot of data from t he Internet. After compiling finished, you will find the following firmware files in \nbin/ar71xx/\n\n\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin\n, for nor flash\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar\n, for nand flash firmware upgrade inside of a working Openwrt firmware\n\n\nopenwrt-ar71xx-nand-gl-ar300m-ubi.img\n, for initial nand flash firmware build, this is used when upgrading using uboot.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is two file for nand firmware. The \nxxx-ubi.img\n is used for first time writing to the nand flash. If you are using uboot to upgrade the firmware, please use this one. The \nxxx-sysupgrade.tar\n is used for upgrading from openwrt. So if you use our stock firmware or already using an openwrt firmware, choose this one.\n\n\nUsing Firmware\n\n\nThe firmware has exactly the same UI as our other mini routers. To determine you are using nor flash or nand flash, please check the available space from the UI.\n\n\nControl which firmware you are booting into\n\n\nThere are two methods to control which firmware you can boot.\n\n\nMethod 1: set boot count\n\n\nThe router will always try to boot into the nand firmware. But if it fails for 3 times it will try to boot into the nor firmware.

You just need to choose \nDHCP\n and click \nSubmit\n.\n\n\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nStatic is required if you want your router have a fixed IP address given by your ISP or in the same subnet of your main router.\n\n\nThe current settings will be automatically filled. Change it according to your needs, then click \nSubmit\n.\n\n\n\n\nPPPoE\n\n\nPPPoE is required by many Internet service providers (ISP). Generally, your ISP will give you a modem and provide you a username and password that you are required to enter so as to access the Internet.\n\n\nEnter your username and password then click \nSubmit\n.\n\n\n\n\nRepeater\n\n\nYou can connect to an existing wireless network by setting it as a repeater. However, there are 2 different modes that you can choose. \n\n\nWISP\n\n\nIn WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode, the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall which protect you from the public network. Therefore, we highly suggest you to chose WISP if you want to connect to a  public wifi.\n\n\nIn the following diagram, your main router has an IP 192.168.1.1. Suppose its netmask is 255.255.255.0, GL.iNet router will have two IP address:\n\n\n192.168.1.99\n which is obtained from your main router\n\n\n192.168.8.1\n which is created by itself\n\n\nSo all your devices connected to GL.iNet router will be protected by its firewall.\n\n\n\n\nTo set up repeater in WISP mode, first Click \nRepeater\n tab in \nInternet Settings\n, the router will search for the available Wi-Fi networks automatically. Then, choose a SSID and enter its password. Choose \nWISP\n in mode and click \nSubmit\n.\n\n\n\n\nWDS\n\n\nIn WDS (Wireless Distribution System), you can connect to an existing wireless network without creating a new subnet. Therefore, the router only act as a device to extend the wireless signal coverage of your main router. There is no firewall between the mini router and the main router.\n\n\nHowever, to use this mode, \nyour main router has to support WDS. Since WDS has different implementation, you'd be better to use the same GL.iNet router\n. Check your main router's manual to see if it supports this function.\n\n\nNote: OpenVPN client function of the mini router will not work in bridge mode.\n\n\n\n\nTo set up repeater in WDS mode, first, \nensure your main router supports WDS.\n Click \nRepeater\n tab in \nInternet Settings\n, the router will search for the available Wi-Fi networks automatically. Then, choose a SSID and enter its password. Choose \nWDS\n in mode and you can enter the LAN IP which will be used to access this router.\n\n\nThis LAN IP should be within the subnet of your main router, but it cannot conflict with any other devices's IP within the same subnet.\n\n\nIf you are not sure, just keep the LAN IP blank so that it will get a IP address from your main router automatically. However, you need to find out this IP in the admin UI of your main router if you want to access the web UI of GL.iNet router again.\n\n\nRelayd\n\n\nIn case your main router doesn't support WDS, you can create a WISP connection first, then set up a relayd overlay.\n\n\nHere is the \ndetailed instructions\n.\n\n\n3G/4G Modem\n\n\nYou can connect to the Internet using 3G or 4G modem. Plug in your modem and click the \n3G/4G\n tab in \nInternet Settings\n to enter the 3G/4G setting page. \n\n\nTo set up 3G/4G modem in \nGL-MiFi\n, you should follow the instructions in \nModem Manager\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe router has pre-configured values. You can choose \nCountry/Region\n,  \nService Provider\n first. The values below will be filled automatically. But this is not necessary if you know the settings. If you found that the data is not updated, please \nwrite to us\n.\n\n\nTo make the correct settings:\n\n\n\n\nModem device\n: Please choose \n/dev/cdc-wdm0\n if this modem support QMI, otherwise you need to choose \nttyUSB*\n. There may be several \nttyUSB\n from 1 to 3. You need to choose the correct one based on modem spec.\n\n\nService Type\n: This is needed for 3G connection only. For 4G connection, this setting is not necessary.\n\n\nAPN\n: This is the most important setting, check your ISP for the correct setting.\n\n\nDial Number\n: Generally, it is a default value and you don't need to set it by yourself. However, if you have this info, please input it.\n\n\nPin, Username and Password:\n Generally, these informations are not necessary for a unlocked SIM card. However, if you have a locked SIM card, please find these informations from your carrier.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Some modems work in host-less mode. If your modem cannot be detected in this setting page, you can click \ntethering\n to find you device.\n\n\nExample (US Verizon)\n\n\n\n\nCompatible Modems\n\n\nHere is a list of supported modems that we tested before. \n\n\nQMI\n\n\nThis modem supports QMI mode.

Download it from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US for windows.\n\n\n\n\n(3) Is it open hardware? \n\n\n    All the Domino boards are open hardware, which you can find the schematics and layout in [Github](https://github.com/domino-team/domino-hardware).\n    Domino Core is based on Atheros proprietary reference design and is not open hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in the whole kit\n\n\nDomino is a high-performance 802.11 bgn WiFi hardware platform, with a modular design architecture, unlimited extension capabilities and Arduino compatibility.\n\n\nDomino is designed using \nAtheros AR9331 WiSoC\n which is widely used in mini routers and IoT projects.\n\n\n\n\nThe Domino Family has now 11 boards and more extensions will be developed. The tree structure of the boards is as illustrated.\n\n\nAt the heart is Domino Core, which can then be extended into Domino Pi and Domino Qi. Domino Pi is a DEV platform for wifi and openwrt, it can be extended with various tile boards. Domino Qi is designed for Arduino compatible. Plug the Domino Qi Mini board onto the Domino Qi baseboard to turn it into a board fully compatible the ubiquitous Arduino Shield form factor.\n\n\nDomino Core\n\n\nDomino Core is the heart of Domino.IO. It is designed for makers to easily build their own products based on it. It is compact, \nonly 1.6 square inches with 60 castellated pins (2mm pitch), 3xEthernet, USB2.0, serial port, SPI, I2S, SLIC, SPDIF, JTAG, 9xLEDs and 29 GPIOs\n. Check the the beautiful pinout diagram below for details.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \nDomino Core hardware\n for more details of the hardware.\n\n\nDomino Pi\n\n\nDomino Pi is designed both as a Domino Core development board and as an extension.

            "text": "OpenVPN Client Setting\n\n\nThis docs is only related to OpenVPN client.\n\n\nOpenVPN client is pre-installed in GL.iNet routers GL-AR150, GL-AR300M, GL-MT300N, GL-MT300A, GL-USB150, GL-AR750, GL-B1300 from firmware v2.19.\n\n\nDownload the firmware for each devices: http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/\n\n\nThe newest firmware maybe put in testing folder: http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/testing/\n\n\nNote: You need to subscribe your own VPN service and get an OpenVPN configuration file (.ovpn) from your service provider. If you have subscribed but don't know how to download the configuration file, please read the section \"How to get the configuration file\".\n\n\nThis guide assumes that you have set up the router properly.\n\n\n1. Create an OpenVPN connection\n\n\n1) Go to OpenVPN page\n\n\nClick the OpenVPN icon on the toolbar. It will ask you to upload the configuration files. This file can be a single .ovpn file or a zip/tar.gz file which contains multiple .ovpn files.\n\n\nBe careful that some .ovpn files use separated ca, cert, crl files. These files must be zipped together with the .ovpn file before upload.\n\n\n\n\n2) Upload your configuration file\n\n\nSimply Drap and drop your file to the area indicated so that it will be uploaded to the router automatically. Next, the router will start to check the file. Refresh the page when you see the file has been successfully uploaded and the .ovpn file has been imported.\n\n\n\n\nFor zip/tar.gz file, the router will unzip the zip/tar.gz file  and check each .ovpn file inside.\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, it will ask you to enter your username and password. This usually happen when your configuration file can be downloaded without login your personal account.\n\n\n\n\n3) Connect to the OpenVPN server\n\n\nAfter refreshing the page, you will be able to configure the OpenVPN connection.\n\n\n\n\nPlease create the VPN connection by following the steps below:\n\n\n\n\nCheck \"Enable\".\n\n\nCheck \"Force VPN\" if you want to force all Internet traffic to go through VPN. However, you will lose Internet access if the VPN is disconnected.\n\n\nThen choose a .ovpn file which you want to use.\n\n\nNow click \"Apply\"\n\n\n\n\nThe router will show the connection progress. Once it is connected, you will be able to see data sent and received.\n\n\n\n\n2. Manage ovpn files\n\n\nFrom firmware \nv2.20\n, there is a simple ovpn manager where you can check the current list of ovpn files. You can purge all the files and start to use another vpn service.\n\n\nWe would like to add more functions in the ovpn manager, you can send us a wish list via email or in the forum. Some proposed functions (this doesn't mean this feature will come in the near future) include:\n\n\n\n\nServer and port probe: to detect if the server is online. This is useful if you are in a censored area and some servers are not accessible at all. But this process is very time consuming.\n\n\nTo intergrate ovpn files into one. Generally the VPN service providers provides one ovpn file for each server then you will have hundreds of ovpn file. You can integrate these files into one and let the router to connect to a random sever.\n\n\nDelete, order and ranking servers. Now we don't have a algorithms to rank the servers, as you will not know the speed unless you try. We can record the speed if you have tried.\n\n\nManage multiple VPN services. While most people just use one service, we don't know if this is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Get the config File\n\n\nWe have tested different VPN service providers. Therefore, if you don't know how to get the configuration file, you can follow the instruction below according to your service provider. However, you have to contact your service provider for the configuration file if they haven't been listed  below. \n\n\nIf you use other service providers and have problem of setting up the OpenVPN, please contact \nsupport@gl-inet.com\n\n\nOpenVPN Service providers:\n\n\nService providers are list according to their names as below,\n\n\nA - D\n\n\nAirVPN\n\n\nhttps://airvpn.org/?referred_by=402389\n\n\n\n\nLogin your AirVPN acoount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\n\nChoose Config Generator on the left and then choose Linux as your operating system.

The \nblue LED\n is for wireless (or WLAN), which will indicate the status of the wireless connection by default, but it can be configured to indicate any other status of the system. \n\n\n\n\nBeside the WLAN LED, there is a button which connects to \nGPIO 11\n. This button can be reconfigured by scripts, but the default action is: \n\n\n\n\nWith a short press, it will toggle the status of WiFi, i.e. it will turn on/off the WiFi; \n\n\nWith a long press (10 seconds), it will revert the system to factory status.\n\n\n\n\nThe ethernet boards have more LEDs. For example, as shown in the photo below, the WAN led and WLAN LED is on.\n\n\n\n\nFirst time use\n\n\nWhen Domino power up for the first time, it will connect to the Internet using DHCP and emit a wifi single with ssid: \nDomino-xxx\n, where \nxxx\n is the last three characters of your MAC address. \n\n\nThe default WiFi password is: \ngoodlife\n.\n\n\nThe first time you use Domino, it is suggested that you connect to it directly using WiFi or connect it directly to your router. Then using a browser (firefox or chrome) to visit \nhttp://domino.local\n to get access to it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Windows and cannot find \ndomino.local\n, you may need to install \nBounjor\n from Apple. Download it from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US \n\n\nThe first time you use your Domino, it will ask you to setup the name and a password. Then reboot your device.\n\n\n\n\nATTENTION\n: The password is only for the embedded Linux system, not your WiFi. If you want to change your wifi password, you can logon to the system and change it later.\n\n\nATTENTION\n: If you change your board's name, for example to \"myboard\", after reboot you will need to use http://myboard.local to find it.\n\n\nHint\n: If you don't want to have a reboot, just go to luci (the url is: http://domino.local/cgi-bin/luci) and set up a password. You will be prompted with a login page.\n\n\nThe Homepage\n\n\nAfter login, you will have a clean homepage, displaying the status of network and USB devices. You have links on the left side to vairous pages of Domino WebUI.\n\n\nYou will also have pie chart displaying your flash usuage.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork settings\n\n\nConnect to the Internet\n\n\nThe default protocol for WAN is \nDHCP\n, but you can change it according to your needs. You have 5 choices, including \nDHCP, Static, PPPoE, 3G, Tethering and WiFi\n. The \n3g\n protocol lets you connect Domino to the internet via a USB 3g/4g modem. The \nTethering\n protocol lets you connect Domino to the internet via an Android phone. The \nWiFi\n choice lets you connect your Domino to an AP (e.g. router) wirelessly.\n\n\n\n\nChange Wifi and LAN settings\n\n\nIn the same page, you can also change WiFi and LAN settings. You can \nenable/disable\n Wifi, change the ssid, security or password. \n\n\nATTENTION\n Turning on WiFi (AP) only affects Domino's AP signal without affecting its connection to your router as a client.\n\n\nATTENTION\n The default LAN IP of Domino Pi is \n192.168.1.1\n. If this is your router's IP as well, please change it to another addres, e.g. \n192.168.240.1\n, in order that it can connect to the internet succefully.\n\n\nWorking with USB devices\n\n\nYou can connect USB devices to Domino with the USB tiles. \n\n\n\n\nIf you connect a USB disk, you will find a pie chart showing its storage usage. By clicking the pi chart, you will be able to list the contents of the storage device.\n\n\nIf you connect a USB webcam, you will have a live video streaming charge in your homepage. Please consult the \"Live video streaming\" page for more details.\n\n\nCode editor\n\n\nBy clicking the \"Editor\" link on the homepage or clicking directly on the flash or USB devices on the homepage, you will be able to list the contents of flash or USB storage and edit the contents of their files.\n\n\n\n\nYou can view or edit individual files directly. \n\n\nATTENTION\n When editing files, your data is not encrypted.\n\n\nATTENTION\n Your Domino board has to be connected to the internet in order to use the web editor, because the browser needs to load some big scripts to display the code nicely!\n\n\nLUCI\n\n\nBy clicking the Luci link on homepage, you will go to the LUCI webui, which is the default webui of openwrt. The webui is for advanced users and we will not explain in detail here.\n\n\n\n\nAt the bottom right corner of the LUCI webui, you will find a link \"Domino Web Panel\". Click it to go back to the Domino UI.\n\n\nSecurities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you change your password, settings, etc, your data is encrypted when trasfered over the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWen you view or modify files using the code editor, the data is NOT encrypted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use a webcam, the default setting does NOT have a password, i.e. it is OPEN TO THE INTERNET. Everyone will be able to see you if there is no firewall. Please refer to the \"Live video streaming\" are for more info.",

This button can be reconfigured by scripts, but the default action is:    With a short press, it will toggle the status of WiFi, i.e. it will turn on/off the WiFi;   With a long press (10 seconds), it will revert the system to factory status.   The ethernet boards have more LEDs. For example, as shown in the photo below, the WAN led and WLAN LED is on.",

Before you continue to change your firmware, read the \nWorking with serial\n section first.\n\n\nFirmware compatibilities\n\n\nDomino is compatible with some common OpenWrt firmwares for the Atheros 9331 SoC, including the firmware for GL-AR150, Carambola2 and Dragino. Due to size and configuration of the bootloader, Domino cannot boot firmware for TP-Link 703n, 720n without changing the bootloader.\n\n\nFlashing firmware using the WebUI\n\n\nWe encourage you to flash your firmware using the WebUI provided. When viewing in \"System\" page, you will see the UI for you to upgrade/flash your firmware. \n\n\n\nIf you want to upload your firmware in your disk, just click \"Choose File\" and upload the firmware. After upload you will be prompted with an option to \"keep settings\" or not. Then click \"UPGRADE\" to upgrade your firmware. You can also upgrade your firmware by clicking the \"Download\" button next to \"Newest version\". \n\n\n\n\nATTENTION\n: In firmware version 1.0 and 1.1, there is a bug for Chrome. Please use Firefox or IE for upgrading your firmware.\n\n\nFlashing using uboot WebUI\n\n\nIn case you accediently brick your Domino firmware, you can debrick using uboot. You don't have to use serial if you want to use the uboot WebUI.\n\n\nStep 1: Connection\n\n\nConnect an Ethernet cable from your computer to Domino directly. Set your computer's IP address to \n192.168.1.2\n manually. If you are using a Dual-Ethernet tile board, \nonly connect one Ethernet cable to your Domino kit\n. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Activate the uboot WebUI\n\n\nPress and hold the reset button while powering on your Domino. You will see the \nBlue LED\n for Wireless flashing. After it flashes 5 times, the WAN led will light up. Now release your finger. The WAN LED will flash quite quickly for some times.\n\n\nStep 3: Flash firmware\n\n\nNow use a web broser and go to http://192.168.1.1. You will then have the uboot WebUI as below.\n\n\n\n\nNow choose your firmware and click \"Update firmware\". Wait about 3 minutes to allow your board to reset and boot.\n\n\nATTENTION\n: DON'T turn off the power during this process.\n\n\nATTENTION\n: Uboot wont check the validity of the firmware. Even if you flashed a wrong firmware, it will still write it to flash.\n\n\nFlashing using uboot console\n\n\nIf your firmware still cannot boot up, try this advanced option. To use uboot console, please refer to \nWorking with serial\n first. \n\n\nATTENTION\n: It is better to use a separate USB-UART adapter to use the uboot console. uboot boots very quickly, so you might not have time to enter the uboot console if you are using an integrated USB-UART bridge. Some systems, especially Windows, are slow to load the correct driver for you.\n\n\nEnter the uboot console\n\n\nIn your serial term, press \nanykey\n when uboot boot and stop it in its console. Some version of uboot will ask your to type \ngl\n to enter the console.\n\n\n\n\nUboot environment variables\n\n\nType \nprintenv\n to display the environment variables. Don't modify these variables if you are not sure what you are doing.\n\n\n\n\nSet up a tftp server\n\n\nYou need to set up a tftp server. In Windows, we recommend \ntftpd32\n or \ntftpd64\n according to your system architecture. Download them from \njunin.net\n.\n\n\nIn Linux, we recommend \ntftpd-hpa\n. Just search google for a guide to use this tool. \n\n\nUpdate using the stored procedure\n\n\nYou can update your firmware or uboot very simply using the procedure stored as environment variables.\n\n\nTo update the firmware, name your firmware file as \nopenwrt-domino.bin\n and put it in your tftp server. Then run \nrun lf\n. Just wait until this process finish.\n\n\nTo update the uboot, name your uboot as \nuboot_for_domino.bin\n and run \nrun lu\n to change the uboot itself.\n\n\nATTENTION\n: Changing uboot can be very dangerous. Do this at your own risk.\n\n\nUpdate using uboot command\n\n\nYou can also update the firmware and everything else using the uboot command.\n\n\nTo update the firmware, use the following command. Replace with your own filename for your firmware.\n\n\ntftp 0x81000000 openwrt-domino.bin\nerase 0x9f050000 +$filesize\ncp.b 0x81000000 0x9f050000 $filesize\n\n\n\n\nTo update the uboot, use the following command. Replace the filename as your real name.\n\n\ntftp 0x81000000 uboot_for_domino.bin\nerase 0x9f000000 0x40000\ncp.b 0x81000000 0x9f000000 0x40000\n\n\n\n\nATTENTION\n: Changing uboot can be very dangerous.

The functions of Qi Mini is compatible with Arduino Yun.\n\n\n\n\nOn Qi Mini, there are four LEDs:\n\n\n\n\nBlue LED for Wireless\n: when radio (ap or client) is on, it will light up.\n\n\n \nWhite LED for USB\n: when USB is connected, it will light up. When connected to Qi baseboard, it will always on because on Qi baseboard there is a USB hub.\n\n\nGreen LED for Power\n: it will always on when power is connected.\n\n\nYellow LED for WAN\n \n: it will light up when Ethernet cable is connected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Qi Mini, there are three buttons:\n\n\n\n\n9331 Reset\n: when pressed, it will perform a hard reset of the 9331 CPU. The OpenWrt Linux will reboot immediately.\n\n\nMCU Reset\n: when pressed, it will reset the AVR MCU immediately.\n\n\nUser Button\n: This button is configured using script. The default actions are: when pressed for 5 seconds and more, it will reset WiFi mode, encryption, password, LAN IP to factory status; when pressed for 30 seconds and more, it will reset the whole system to factory default. e.g. all your change will be erased.\n\n\n\n\nQi Assembly\n\n\nThe Qi Mini board use short headers. Put it onto Qi baseboard and press them firmly. On Qi baseboard, the MicroUSB is only for power and we didn't mount it by default. You can just power the kit up using the connector on Qi Mino.\n\n\n\n\nTo disassemble the kit, you need a little force, as the headers are too tight. Use a pencil or plastic pen, inser into the gap between Qi Mini and the baseboard, apply a little force to lever it up. Don't be too brutal to damage the boards. Don't use a metal tools. \n\n\n\n\nUsing Qi\n\n\nWhen using Domino Qi, you can connect the MicroUSB to you computer and connect Cable to your router. When Domino Qi is powered up, it will broadcast with SSID \nDomino-xxx\n, where \nxxx\n is the last three letters of your MAC address. If you don't use Qi baseboard, you can connect to Qi Mini via WiFi. \n\n\nThe default WiFi password is \ngoodlife\n.\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the Web UI\n\n\nWhen your Domino is up, you will find it using \nhttp://domino.local\n in your browser. \n\n\nIf you cannot find domino.local in your windows, you need to install \nBounjor\n from Apple. Download it from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US\n\n\n\n\nFirst time settings\n\n\nThe first time you use your Domino, it will ask you to setup the name and a password. Then reboot your device.\n\n\n\n\nATTENTION: The password is only for the embedded Linux system, not your wifi. If you want to change your wifi password, logon the system and change it later.ATTENTION: If you change your boards name, for example to \u201cmyboard\u201d, after reboot, you will need to use http://myboard.local to find it.\n\n\nHint\n: If you don\u2019t want to have a reboot, just go to luci (the url is: http://domino.local/cgi-bin/luci) and set up a password, you will be able to prompt with a login page.\n\n\nThe homepage\n\n\nAfter login, you will have a clean homepage, displaying the status of network and USB devices. You have links on the left side to vairous pages of Domino WebUI.\n\n\n\n\nYou will also have pie chart displaying your flash usuage. On the bottom, you can upload your sketch to your AVR. \n\n\nNetwork settings\n\n\nConnect to the Internet\n\n\n\n\nThe default protocol for WAN is DHCP, but you can change it according to your needs. You have 5 choices, including DHCP, Static, PPPoE, 3G, Tethering and WiFi. The 3g protocol let you connect domino to the Internet via a USB 3g/4g modem. The Tethering protocol let you connect Domino to the Internet via an Android phone. The WiFi choice let you connect your Domino to an AP (e.g. router) wirelessly.\n\n\nChange Wifi and LAN settings\n\n\nIn the same page, you can also change WiFi and LAN settings. You can \nenable/disable\n Wifi, change the ssid, security or password. \n\n\nATTENTION\n: Turning on WiFi (AP) only affect Domino\u2019s ap signal without affecting its connection to your router as client.\n\n\nATTENTION\n: The default LAN IP of Domino Pi is \n192.168.240.1\n.
