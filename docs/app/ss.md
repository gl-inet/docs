# Shadowsocks (SS) Setting
===

You will learn how to set up shadowsocks server and client on the mini router in this guide. This guide is for DIY purpose and provided as is. To do the following steps, you have to learn how to use SSH and WinSCP to connect to the router first.

# Setup SS Server

Note: If you want to use your router as Shadowsocks server, you have to have Internet IP address that it can be access everywhere. Your ISP should also allow you to use as servers otherwise it is not accessible worldwide.


## 1. Edit Shadowsocks-server.json file

Input the following command to edit the configuration file "**shadowsocks-server.json**“ 

`root@GL-AR750:~# vi /etc/shadowsocks-server.json` 

Then the following file content will display.

switch to edit mode by press `i` on your keyboard, then you can change parameter in the configuration file: 

1. Server：`0.0.0.0` (default, don't modify)
2. server_port: `443` (default, 443 is the port for https so it is good for camouflage)
3. password:  ***your password*** This is the only thing that you have to set up by yourself.
4. method: `rc4-md5` is default encrypt method, rc4-md5 is the fastest encryption method. 

when you finish all above modification, you can click `Esc` to exit edit mode, then click `:`, type`wq` to `write` the modification into the configuration files and `quit`.

Click "**Add**" after filling relate information and scroll down to the bottom, then click "**save&apply**" 

Now the port forwarding shall be activated and also the Shadowsocks Server is ready to use. 

## 5. Port forward

You don't need to setup port forward if you are using the GL router as the main router. 

But if connect the mini router to your main router as a client, you need to setup port forwarding in your main router.

Todo: port forward in other brand of router.

## 6. Check your public IP address

You can use any of your PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone to connect your Wi-Fi, then open a web browser (IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.)

Open any IP address checking website, the following websites are for your options: 

1. www.myipaddress.com
2. www.checkip.org 
3. https://www.whatismypublicip.com/
4. https://www.showmyipaddress.eu/
5. http://ip.w69b.com/

The webpage will detect and show your public IP address, **record** it. 

## 7. Configuration is ready

Now your ss server info is ready. Please write this down so that you can use to connect to your server.
* Server IP: Your public server IP
* Encryption: rc4-md5
* Password: your password


# Using SS on PCs or Smartphones

## 1. Download the clients of your OS platform: 

https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html

## 2. Setup your client on different devices

Install the Shadowsocks Client on your device (iOS, Android or Windows devices), then setup the following information:

Host: **your Public IP address** (you checked in step **3.2**)

Port: `443`

Password: **your password** (same as you setup in ss-server)

Encryption: `rc4-md5` (same as you select in ss-server)

## 3. Start using Private Shadowsocks Services

After setup, you just start your shadowsocks on your devices, enjoy it. 

You can test or check whether it's workable by open a web browser on your smartphone (use 3G/4G data but not WiFi), then go to a IP address checking website to check if the IP address is same as your SS-server public IP address.
