Using SSH and WinSCP
===

SSH and WinSCP are basic tools if you want to play more with the mini router.

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users. Sometime you need to have basic tools to ssh to the server (e.g. When you need to set up Shadowsocks server ). This guide is how to SSH login to the GL.iNet routers.

WinSCP is the windows tool which runs on top of SSH to connect and edit files on the router. In Linux you can use `scp`. But WinSCP is the best tool on windows.



# SSH to the Router for Windows Users

# WinSCP

WinSCP is a much easier tool to edit files on the router if you are using Windows.

## 1. Download WinSCP

Download WinSCP from here: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php and install in your Windows.

## 2. Connect to the router

Run WinSCP, choose `SCP` as the protocol. If you didn't change the IP of the router it should be `192.168.8.1`. Please use your real IP of the router. Port number should be `22`. Please `root` as the username and input your real password. Then click `Login` button.

# SSH to the router for Linux/Mac User

The process on Linux and Mac OS are generally the same. Below we use Ubuntu as as example.

If this happens, run the command in the red box. Please copy the exact command which is displayed in your terminal.

`ssh-kengen -f "~/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.8.1"`
