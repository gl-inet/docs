Domino Qi Baseboard
================

Overview
------------

The Domino Qi Base Board is an adapter board for the Domino Mini Board.

Plug the Domino Qi Mini Board onto this Domino Qi Base Board in order to be fully compatible with the ubiquitous ArduinoTM Shield form factor and benefit from hundreds of already existing shields for rapid prototyping.

The Domino Qi Base Board extends the Domino Qi Mini Board by adding the following features:

* 3x USB 2.0 Low / Full / High-speed USB Hub + MicroSD Card Reader Combo Chip AU6350-MGL (Datasheet)
* 1x IEEE 802.3 10/100 Ethernet Port
* 1x USB-A R/A Vertical Socket for USB 2.0 Low / Full / High-speed Host Port
* 2x USB 2.0 Low / Full / High-speed Host Ports on standard PC USB front-panel-type 2x5 Header
* 1x MicroSD Card Slot (Push to Lock / Push to Unlock)
* 1x MicroUSB connector for +5V power supply, featuring an onboard +3.3V/2A switching DC/DC converter

The Domino Qi Base Board provides the standard ArduinoTM shield connectors:

* ATMega32U4 ICSP (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS)
* ATMega32U4 RESET pin
* ATMega32U4 UART (TXD1, RXD1)
* ATMega32U4 I2C (SDA, SCL)
* ATMega32U4 digital (+ PWM) pins (D4-D6 and IO8-13)
* ATmega Analog pins (A0-5 + AREF)
* Arduino Yun<sup>TM</sup>-compatible pins (HANDSHAKE, GP6)
* +5V, +3.3V and GND power supply pins

**Note**: Domino is not connected to ArduinoTM and the Domino Qi Mini product is a derivative. Any technical support must be directed to us, not to Arduino<sup>TM</sup>.
