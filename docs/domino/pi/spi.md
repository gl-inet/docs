========

Mounting
----------
When using the SPI/JTAG tile board, it is important to mount the tile board in the correct direction. The jtag pins should face outside, as shown in the picture below.

When connecting the flash adapter, connect it as shown in the picture below. The flash should be mounted on the bottom part of the adapter. Be sure the flash is mounted in the connector properly by chekcing that the dot on the flash chip is in the correct corner.
