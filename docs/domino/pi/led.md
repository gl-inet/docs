Domino LED Tile Board
===================

Overview
------------

When connected to the Domino Pi board, the Domino LED Tile adds the following LEDs:

* 1x Blue LED: WLAN (LED0)
* 1x White LED: USB (LED1)
* 4x Green LEDs: LAN1-4 (LED2-5)
* 1x Red LED: WAN (LED6)
* 1x Orange LED: SYS (LED7)
* 1x Yellow LEd: WPS (LED8)
* The Domino LED Tile connects as a West-side Tile.

It is only compatible with the Domino Pi board, as the Domino Qi Mini does not feature LED GPIOs, but instead integrates the standard Arduino Yun<sup>TM</sup> LEDs.
