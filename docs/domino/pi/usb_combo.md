Overview
--------------

When connected to the Domino Pi or Domino Qi Mini board, the Domino 3x USB / MicroSD Combo Tile adds:

* 1x **USB-A** R/A Horizontal Socket for USB 2.0 Low / Full / High-speed Host Port

	echo "6" > /sys/class/gpio/export
	echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/6/direction
	echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio6/value
```
