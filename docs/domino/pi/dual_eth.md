Domino Dual Ethernet Tile Board
========================

Overview
------------------

When connected to the Domino Pi board, the Domino Dual Ethernet Tile adds 2x standard RJ45 IEEE 802.3 10/100MB Ethernet ports:

* 1x LAN on port P0, DCE wiring (1=R+, 2=R-, 3=T+, 6=T-), lower RJ45 Jack
* 1x WAN on port P4, DTE wiring (1=T+, 2=T-, 3=R+, 6=R-), upper RJ45 Jack
* UART connectors

The Domino Dual Ethernet Tile also includes the equivalent of the Domino LED Tile:

* 1x Blue LED: WLAN (LED0)
* 1x White LED: USB (LED1)
* 4x Green LEDs: LAN1-4 (LED2-5)
* 1x Red LED: WAN (LED6)
* 1x Orange LED: SYS (LED7)
* 1x Yellow LED: WPS (LED8)

The Domino Dual Ethernet Tile connects as a West-side Tile.

It is only compatible with the Domino Pi board, as the Domino Qi Mini does not feature 2x Ethernet ports.
