# Using Uboot to Debrick Your Router

You may brick your router if you were doing some DIY projects or flashed a wrong firmware. You are not able to access your router but you can re-install the firmware by using Uboot failsafe.

Please follow the procedures below to access the Uboot Web UI and re-install the firmware:

---

## 1. Connect

Connect **only one** cable to your router, and leave **the other port (LAN or WAN) unconnected**.

## 2. Press and Hold

Press and hold the *Reset* button firmly first, and then power on your device. **Must obey the first and then procedure**.

## 3. Lights

The LEDs will start blinking.

## 4. Release

Release your finger when you see the LEDs flashing:
- 5 times for GL-AR150 and GL-AR300M16

- 3 times for GL-MT300N, GL-MT300A, and GL-B1300

## 5. Set IP

Set your computer’s IP address to **192.168.1.2** (see the cap-screen of Win 7 below)
