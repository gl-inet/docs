#  GL-AR750 Travel AC Router



The first dual-band AC travel router. We added one more Ethernet port (totally 3) so that it fit better for fixed usage scenario as well. It has a MicroSD (TF) slot which increase your storage space up to 128GB.

It has PoE options which is the best choice for affordable wifi coverage.

The 2.4G antenna is on the PCB and don't have a uFL connector. While the 5G antenna has uFL connector.
